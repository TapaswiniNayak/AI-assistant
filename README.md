#INTRODUCTION

In today’s world, AI has taken over almost every aspect of different fields of our society. One of the most important inventions of AI is Voice recognition executed by Voice assistances. At the most basic level, the virtual assistant is a sort of chatbot which is a software agent that interprets human speech and response via synthesized voices. It allows humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. The main objective is to build your own personal and efficient AI voice assistant through Speech Recognition like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and Google assistant.
Thus, NEOTREK: A Virtual Assistant based on AI is an intelligent personal assistant which can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions. 


#TECHNOLOGIES USED

To make a Voice recognition system, we have used the following technologies:

1.	Python
•	Python is an interpreter, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
•	Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.


2.	HTML
HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless of the complexity of a site or the number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.


3.	CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should appear on the front end of the page.


4.	JavaScript
JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.

	
5.	VS Code
Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.



#OBJECTIVE

Voice recognition enables consumers to multitask by speaking directly to their Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or other voice recognition technology. By using machine learning and sophisticated algorithms, voice recognition technology can quickly turn your spoken word into written text. The main objective is to build your own personal and efficient AI voice assistant through Speech Recognition like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and Google assistant.
